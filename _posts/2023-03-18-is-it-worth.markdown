Is it worth start to write a blog in 2023? In video and chatGPT era?!

I've been asking myself this question multiple times, but in the end here we are! So I guess that my answer was (and *is*) "Yes".

The reason is that it is worth *for me*. As I wrote in the description I'm going to write it mainly for myself because:

* Writing clarifies thoughts
* Making them public should be a motivation to persist in projects (at least I hope... this had always been my pain point: to have ideas and then abandon them)
* It is a good exercise to improve my english
* If, in the end, someone else will find this useful or enjoyable, even better!

So, let's start.
